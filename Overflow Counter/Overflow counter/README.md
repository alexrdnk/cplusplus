This program implements an interactive counter with overflow handling.
It contains a Counter class with methods for increasing, decreasing, resetting and displaying the counter value as well as for setting minimum and maximum limits.
The program has a user-friendly menu for working with the counter, and input validation ensures that the limits are set correctly.
The project demonstrates strong C++ programming skills, including OOP concepts, input validation, error handling and a menu-based user interface.

Your counter looks like 0 : minimal value.
At each step, you can either add or subtract one to the minimum value.
If the number on the right exceeds the maximum value, the counter will look like this: 1 : 0
